"""ForgeSmith SIMBA — Targeted rule generation from failure patterns.

SIMBA (Systematic Identification of Mistakes and Behavioral Adjustments) analyzes
agent_episodes for high-variance tasks and uses Claude to generate specific
improvement rules that go beyond the generic pattern-matching in extract_lessons().

Pipeline position: runs after evaluate, before propose (Phase 2.75).

    # Standalone for testing

Analyze the contrast between successes and failures. Identify specific, actionable patterns that distinguish them. Then generate up to {MAX_RULES_PER_ROLE} new rules.

Requirements for each rule:
1. MUST be 1-2 sentences, max 200 characters
2. MUST be specific and actionable (not generic advice like "plan better")
3. MUST reference concrete behaviors observed in the data (e.g., "When exploring a codebase, use parallel Read calls instead of sequential ones to avoid burning turns")
4. MUST NOT duplicate any existing rules listed above
5. Each rule MUST include an error_type from: timeout, max_turns, early_terminated, agent_error, test_failure

Respond with ONLY a JSON array of objects, each with:
- "rule": the rule text (1-2 sentences, max 200 chars)
- "error_type": which failure pattern this addresses
- "rationale": why this rule would help (1 sentence)

Example:
[

    "rule": "When task description mentions 'sync' or 'diff', limit exploration to 10 turns then start writing code with what you know.",
    "error_type": "early_terminated",
