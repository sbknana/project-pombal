"""
Test suite for early termination signals in forge_orchestrator.py.

Tests verify:
1. _check_stuck_phrases detects stuck signal phrases correctly
2. _check_stuck_phrases is case-insensitive
3. _check_stuck_phrases returns None for clean text
4. _check_repeated_tool_calls detects 4 identical consecutive calls
5. _check_repeated_tool_calls returns False for varied calls
6. _check_repeated_tool_calls handles short history gracefully
7. EARLY_TERM_EXEMPT_ROLES includes all expected roles
8. EARLY_TERM_WARN_TURNS, EARLY_TERM_FINAL_WARN_TURNS, and EARLY_TERM_KILL_TURNS have correct values
9. _detect_tool_loop integrates correctly with early termination thresholds
10. Escalating warning thresholds are ordered correctly (warn < final_warn < kill)
11. Output hash computed for tool results (_compute_output_hash)
12. Same input + same output detected as stuck (stronger loop signal)
13. Same input + different output not flagged as stuck loop
14. Output hash handles None/empty content gracefully
15. Dead code _check_repeated_tool_calls removed
16. Alternating (A-B-A-B) loop detection triggers at 6+ failing alternations
17. Alternating loop warns at 4+ failing alternations
18. Successful alternating calls are not flagged
19. Mixed success/failure alternating patterns correctly detected
20. Three-way rotation (A-B-C) does not false-positive as alternating
21. Alternating detection coexists with consecutive detection
22. EARLY_COMPLETE: signal parsed correctly from agent text
23. EARLY_COMPLETE waits for message end (multi-line context parsing)
24. EARLY_COMPLETE not confused with RESULT: markers
25. EARLY_COMPLETE cost still tracked (result dict shape)
26. early_completed distinct from early_terminated (success vs failure)
27. False EARLY_COMPLETE in quoted/code text is ignored
28. Budget message returned at periodic intervals (every 5 turns)
29. Budget halfway warning at 50% threshold
30. Budget critical warning at 75% threshold
31. No budget message at turn 0 or when not on interval
32. Budget constants have expected values
33. Budget message includes correct remaining turn count
34. Budget message not returned when max_turns is None
35. Cost breaker terminates when total cost exceeds complexity-scaled limit
36. Cost breaker handles None cost gracefully (treated as $0.00)
37. Cost limits scale with complexity: simple=$3, medium=$5, complex=$10, epic=$20
38. Cost limits configurable via dispatch_config overrides
39. Early termination results recorded in LoopDetector for cross-cycle learning
40. Cost estimate for killed runs uses COST_ESTIMATE_PER_TURN ($0.15) formula
41. Preflight detects Node.js project via package.json
42. Preflight detects Go project via go.mod
43. Preflight detects Python project via requirements.txt/pyproject.toml
44. Preflight detects C# project via .csproj
45. Preflight skipped for build-fix tasks (task description contains fix/build/compile/broken)
46. Preflight failure returns useful error context for injection
47. Preflight timeout constant is 60 seconds
48. Preflight does not block task (returns tuple, never raises)
49. Preflight returns unknown for directories with no recognized project files
50. Preflight skip keywords contain expected build-fix keywords
