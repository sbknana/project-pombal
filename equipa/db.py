    Replaces the bare ``conn = get_db_connection(...)`` / ``conn.close()``
    pattern with a single ``with`` block that:

      * always closes the connection (even on exception) — closes the QS-01
        connection-leak family that re-surfaced across 10+ security reviews;
      * commits on clean exit when ``write=True``;
      * rolls back on exception when ``write=True`` so partial writes never
        leak past the failure boundary.

    Read-only handles do not commit/rollback (the underlying connection is
    opened in URI ``mode=ro``), but they still get the guaranteed close.

    The connection is obtained from :func:`get_db_connection`, so every handle
    yielded here already has ``PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000`` applied (read-only
    and write alike) — a blocked writer waits up to 5s for a competing lock to
    clear instead of failing immediately under EQUIPA's N-parallel-agent load.

    Companion to the stderr ``[GATE-AUDIT]`` emit in

    remains the primary, synchronous record; this adds a durable row so a
    post-hoc audit of "why did this branch merge or block" survives log
    rotation / a lost nohup file.

    FAIL-OPEN (task #2702): any DB error — locked file, missing table, bad
    schema — is logged and swallowed. This function must NEVER raise into the
    merge/gate path. The gate DECISION itself stays fail-closed in
    ``dispatch._gated_merge_task``; only this audit persistence is
    non-blocking.

    ``agent_actions`` has no dedicated ``action_type``/``message`` column, so
    the gate event is mapped onto the existing columns:

      * ``tool_name``          = ``"gate-audit"``  (the action-type discriminator)
      * ``tool_input_preview`` = the full audit ``message`` text
      * ``role``               = ``"security-gate"``
      * ``error_summary``      = ``event`` tag when supplied (queryable filter)
      * ``cycle_number`` / ``turn_number`` = 0 (a gate event is not tied to a
        dev-test cycle or agent turn)

    When ``task_id`` is ``None`` (not supplied by the caller / not parseable)
    the DB row is skipped, because ``agent_actions.task_id`` is ``NOT NULL``;
    the stderr line already carries the event text in that case.

    Args:
        message: the full audit line text (stored verbatim for the audit trail).
        task_id: the task the gate event belongs to; ``None`` skips the write.
        event: short event tag (e.g. ``"merge-succeeded"``) stored as a
            queryable filter in ``error_summary``. Optional.
        counts: finding counts dict; currently informational only (the message
            text already renders them). Accepted so callers can pass structured
            data without stringifying it themselves.
